## ❌ What NOT to Showcase Yet

### Avoid These (Until Headers Are Fixed):

- ❌ "0% secure" or any percentage score
- ❌ "X% compliance"
- ❌ "30 websites fully secured"
- ❌ Raw security scores or metrics

**Why:** These are internal metrics, not marketing messages. Scores will improve after headers are added.

## 📊 After Headers Are Added

Once you add security headers and re-scan, you can then add:

**If score > 80%:**
> "30 websites monitored with 80%+ security compliance"

**If score 50-80%:**
> "30 websites monitored with enterprise-grade security controls"

**Always keep the process-focused messaging too:**
> "Continuous automated security scanning with OWASP Top-10 alignment"

## 🔒 Security Badge Text

**Current (Safe):**
- "OWASP-Aligned • Continuously Monitored"
- "Security Monitored"
- "Enterprise Security Controls"

**After Headers (If Score > 80%):**
- "80%+ Security Compliance"
- "Enterprise-Grade Security"

## ✅ Key Principles

1. **Focus on process, not scores** - Showcase what you're doing
2. **Be truthful** - Everything you say must be factually accurate
3. **Emphasize monitoring** - Continuous scanning is valuable
4. **Highlight standards** - OWASP Top-10 alignment matters
5. **Show reporting** - Audit-ready reports are enterprise-grade
